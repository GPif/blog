What is like to be a developer in 2020. When we think about it, coding is more and more accessible, everyone can create their own website for their business or personal branding. Services delivers pre-made solution for basically every digital needs.

Today, it is quite easy to develop. You do not need a lot of knowledge to deliver a working product. And, as there is a lot of job in the domain, many reconvert as a developer.

So, what makes the difference between a wannabe coder and an experienced one.

# Develop, does'nt start by writing code

So, you have a project, and your first step is to open your favorite text editor to write the entry point of your program. And step by step add every feature needed to achieve your goal. Bad idea! This is how you typically create a tentacular unreadable and unmaintanble piece of software. The result will likely :

* be unreadable, only you will be able to navigate amongst the maze created, and even, if you will be lost if you have to go throw the code you have written six month ago.
* full of technical flows and lacking optimisation
* hard to debug
* impossible to test

## How to split

The first step when you want to tackle a project is to start by decomposing, whether you use an oriented object language, a functional language or whatever, the first step to design a software of any kind, is to determine the pieces that it compose. Generally, after this step you should notice the emeregence of some [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). Good news, you can now refere to a well documented legacy of software designer.
So far, you have not written a single line of code but your software have all its structure. Half th job is done

## What you need

Knowing a bit more on what the code will look like,  you can figure out your needs, what library will it depends, does it lie on database, on what kind? A relation based one or a document one, how you will test. 

## Thinking ahead on how and where it will run

# Develop, doesn't end once delivered

## You should have tested

## There will be bug and not only bugs

## It can be a time bomb

# It is not only about your code
