What is like to be a developer in 2020? The question is worst asking as I see many confusions, long time ago it was the geeky genius, living in the dark, socially disabled, to the cool start up west cost millenials, still facing its screen, still doing mystical things.

There the confusion convey by pop-culture, develop is producing code. Ask him/her something and it will furiously tip on its keyboard making its magic and creating the service that now worth millions, and in less than an hour.

Truth is, the magic is not that complicated, language and framework make it less and less complicated. Many become a developer, as it is not so mystical and thee is still this romantic representation.

The reality is quite different

# Coding is not 100% of your project

Many time we tend to rush writing code, thinking that our productivity is directly related to the number of line produced. This conception is harmfull and must be tackle. Start coding to fast is likely to give the following result :

* Unreadable code, only the creator will be able to navigate amongst the maze created, and even, you will be lost if you have to go throw the code you have written six month ago.
* Lots of technical flows and lacking optimisation
* Hard to debug
* Impossible to test

First thing to do is to plan and think ahead what to do, the first tool is not an IDE, but the one that help to plan, either is a pen and paper, a white board, a post-it or any project management software.

I like to answer the following questions sequentially :

1. What is the logical sequence to achieve the project ?
2. How to decompose this sequence in smallest pieces (Object/Module/Libraries) ?
3. How it will run in production? What architecture
4. How can I build a dev environment close to this architecture ?
5. How do I deploy and test, make sure it works when used

## 1. Think ahead how it will work

This first step is to outline the global behaviour of the product, what are the input, the output. It is to translate a common words of a need into technical solutions. The question is generally asked with the obvious statements like "I need to save this fields into a database", they are more likely to be "I need to setup a site to sell my products". The developer is the one to provide solutions to a problem.

## 2. Decompose

With experience, one of the instinct a developer grow is to detect code smells, meaning piece of code that should not be this way. A block with to much conditions, a methods doing to many things.

The key is to split into smallest methods, decompose the code into logical modules. Every methods should do only and only one thing as the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles recommends.
If done well it should emerge some well known  [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

## 3. What will it be in production

As part of the solution a developer must provide, explaining how it run is also part of the job. Some wold tell it is a sysadmin one, but in the end developing is also responsible to ask or build the architecture under. The [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) principle is mainly the formalization of what works in project, dev and operator that understand each other.

## 4. Building dev environment

Stick close to the production environment while developing is a good way to avoid bad surprise when going into production. 

Fortunately most framework, language provide every thing, therefore it is easy to have a close to production setup thanks to [docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).

## 5. Create and tests

Last part is to have a good test framework suited to our languages. I will not lie, tests runner are according to me still a work in progress, and quite painful to setup. And the first test is quite hard to make it works. But once done, it ensure that the code is and remain perfectly working, split into separated tasks.

There is many steps to build a sustainable system. To avoid any headache, [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) , the system should not be complicated, and easy to maintain.

# The work is not finish after the last line

Other clich√©, is the genius working all night long and with the first beam of the morning sun, look delighted to its screen of a finished work. Unfortunately, the limit is not that net. Result is that people are often reluctant to deliver, as the code is never perfect enough. And this for two reasons :

* Fear of being judge, there some part of the code a developer is ashame of and do not want to be seen by there peers.
* The fear to deliver something that is not working. As a homework we are reluctant to give as it will not give us good grades.

In fact, it took me time to realize that the delivery is not the end of the road, far from that. It is better to deliver fast, as soon as the [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is working. Getting feedback as fast as possible allow a projet to stay align with the user need, especially if it tend t change with time.

* Deliver and get feedback
* Fix bug without breaking
* Add features
* Back and force like any modern project

# Make something that works is easy, make something that last is hard 

## Less code is better

* Easier to maintain
* Elegant and robust
* Sign of a good design (sens of code smell)

# You will and must not keep your code for yourself

* Work with team to grow
* Share to learn
* Give back to the community, (who gave you a lot)
* Share, not to be stuck endlessly with your burden



What is like to be a developer in 2020. When we think about it, coding is more and more accessible, everyone can create their own website for their business or personal branding. Services delivers pre-made solution for basically every digital needs.

Today, it is quite easy to develop. You do not need a lot of knowledge to deliver a working product. And, as there is a lot of job in the domain, many reconvert as a developer.

So, what makes the difference between a wannabe coder and an experienced one.

# Develop, does'nt start by writing code

So, you have a project, and your first step is to open your favorite text editor to write the entry point of your program. And step by step add every feature needed to achieve your goal. Bad idea! This is how you typically create a tentacular unreadable and unmaintanble piece of software. The result will likely :

* be unreadable, only you will be able to navigate amongst the maze created, and even, if you will be lost if you have to go throw the code you have written six month ago.
* full of technical flows and lacking optimisation
* hard to debug
* impossible to test

## How to split

The first step when you want to tackle a project is to start by decomposing, whether you use an oriented object language, a functional language or whatever, the first step to design a software of any kind, is to determine the pieces that it compose. Generally, after this step you should notice the emeregence of some [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). Good news, you can now refere to a well documented legacy of software designer.

So far, you have not written a single line of code but your software have all its structure. Half the job is done

## Thinking ahead on how and where it will run

Knowing a bit more on what the code will look like, you can figure out your needs, what library will it depends on, does it lie on database, of what kind? A relation based one or a document one, how you will test. 

Once this questions answered, you can figure out the architectural schema needed. It can be quite simple, for instance, a simple webapp will only need an application server and a database, to more complicated, if you need a micro service applications with an asynchron message passing service.

## What you need?

It is time to setup your dev environment. Generally it is about taking your architecture schema an figure out how to run them locally. You can either run them all or use some mock to simulate there behavior. Also, how to setup a test environment and a continuous integration.

## Time to code!

Yes, about time, there you will see that it is just a translation of what you planned in previous steps.

# Develop, doesn't end once delivered

The deadline of a project, or the time it is delivered can been seen as the end of a journey, when we can now move to another one, with fresh new idea. It is not :) Your product is now used, visible, you my have some feedback, and if you want your baby to stay alive, you have to take care of it.

## You should have tested

I didn't put the emphasis on this before, but test is essential, and make sense once in production. Why? Because now you will use them to make sure the tiny modification you make will not crash the whole application. At this moment you will get the reward of the extra time you spend writing your tests. Thanks to them you avoid spending your weekend bringing back your service trying to limit the amount of money lost by a production failure.

## There will be bug and not only bugs

When you are young and confident developer, you think you are good enough to produce a flawless code elegantly design. It never append, worst, you rarely deliver a perfect code. Or if you do so, it means that you should have delivered earlier. 

Modern project management imply a lot of back and forth, with evolution, meaning you will break you perfect creation, the last unexpected feature can deeply break you fine tuned code landscape. 
Either it is the old [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), the [V cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model) or the controversial [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

With the years, there are several basic rules I learned :

* Do not make your code perfect, focus on covering MVP code of your project first
* Unitary tests! You will be rewarded, and thank you past self for that
* Do not anticipate features, they are unlikely to happen and you will produce code for nothing.
* Be [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) or if you are not in OO, split your code, and make sure that each part do only one thing. Thus it is easy to add or drop part of your code.
* Communicate with the user if you can. He can tell you if the complicate demand can be simpler if you slightly address it differently, and you can propose some behavior it would not think possible.

In a word, your code must be design to be flexible, able to be remodel, redesign. Able to welcome code to fix bug or new feature without loosing its maintainability.

## It can be a time bomb

Depends on what your career will be, what path you take, but one day you will have to go back to a piece of software you have done years ago. So if your code go ugly, not tested or unmaintained, it will blow on your own face. 

Because now you have to update libraries, connect to a new service, or whatever. As a developer, you want to grow knowing and testing new technologies, not stuck in your old project. Yet as the sole and only specialist of your code, you will be skipped from interesting project to take care of your burden. Trust me, you have better to make your code readable and easy to transmit for your own sake.

# It is not only about your code

You will not work alone, in a team in your job, on open source project among a community. If you want to last, you must fit to a common coding style, and accept the tiny default of other developer. You will not be able to focus or criticize the tiny line of code or you lost the very interest of working with a team. You must accept other and be constructive on your criticize so you are not the [talented jerk](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) we put aside.
